Zustand is a small, fast, and flexible state management library for React.
It provides a simple API with minimal boilerplate compared to Redux.
The core idea is to create a central store using the "create" function.

Unlike Redux, Zustand does not require actions or reducers.
You directly define state properties and mutator functions inside the store.
This keeps your code clean and easy to maintain.

Zustand also has excellent support for TypeScript.
You can strongly type your store state and actions for better developer experience.

One of the biggest advantages is performance.
Zustand only re-renders components that actually use the updated state,
thanks to its internal selector mechanism.

It also supports middleware like persistence (localStorage),
logging, and even async actions with async/await.

Developers often prefer Zustand because it feels lightweight,
but still scales to complex applications without extra overhead.

In summary, Zustand is a pragmatic choice if you want a fast,
minimal, and developer-friendly state manager for React projects.
